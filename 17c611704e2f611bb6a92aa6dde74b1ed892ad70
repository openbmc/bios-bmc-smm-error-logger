I\u0027m actually not 100% sure how the split looks now that we have the BEJ as the separate repo / library so if there\u0027s not much code that goes in this repo, this is fine too",

      "message": "I am not sure putting this in another repo make sense since this is only used by RDE handler and RDE handler is used by the bios-bmc circular buffer.\n \nWhen you said \"separate\" library, did you mean inside this same repo but use a separate static_library() call?",
